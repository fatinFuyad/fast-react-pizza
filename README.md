# Fast React Pizza Co.

A Simple Pizza Ordering App

## Description

Welcome to Fast React Pizza Co., a user-friendly application designed to make your pizza ordering experience as simple and enjoyable as possible.

## How it works

Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API. The API responds with a unique order ID which is then display to the user.

## Features

No Account Required: Just input your name and you’re ready to order. No need to remember another password!

Dynamic Menu: Our pizza menu is loaded from an API, ensuring you always have the latest options at your fingertips.

Easy Ordering: Add multiple pizzas to your cart and place your order with just your name, phone number, and address. If possible, provide your GPS location for easier delivery.

Priority Orders: In a hurry? Mark your order as “priority” for an additional 20% of the cart price and we’ll get your pizza to you as fast as possible.

Post-Order Modifications: Changed your mind? You can mark your order as “priority” even after it has been placed.

Payment on Delivery: No need to enter credit card information. Just pay when your pizza arrives.

Unique Order ID: Every order gets a unique ID, so you can easily look up your order later.
